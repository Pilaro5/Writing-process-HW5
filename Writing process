Why talk about ehtics of autonomous vehicles? 

Moral decisions in unpredictable road conditions
Liability issues and establishing responsibility
Not discouraging potential buyers

Vehicle must learn to make ethical decisions in any situation. 
Has to make judgements even when they involve inevitable harm. 
Quantification of life? Must have an algorithm capable of minimizing harm
Poses many ethical questions when considering certain scenarios
Trolley problem

Two approaches to dealing with these moral issues

Decisions based on an explicit moral code
-Advantages
--Consistency and predictability of the outcome
--Easily tunable by manufacturers
-Disadvantages
--Spanning every possible situation
--Ambiguity of input data

Decisions based on data and machine learning
-Benefits
--No need to code for every possible situation
--Can closely mimic human behavior 
--Can implement reasonable rule breaking behavior 
-Drawbacks
--No explicit code means unpredictability
--Difficult to correct and fine tune moral code
